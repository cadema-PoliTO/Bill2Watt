This repository contains code and data for the project of "data-driven prediction of hourly load profiles from the time-of-use energy bills".

## Description

This project focuses on training a data-driven model to predict hourly load profiles of heterogeneous and numerous electricity end users. The aim is to leverage the time-of-use energy bill, which provides valuable insights into the consumption patterns of the end users. A regression model is developed to effectively map energy bills to their corresponding load profiles.

The project includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to gain insights into the dataset and understand the characteristics of the electricity consumption patterns. The EDA is performed on a training/testing dataset, while the detailed implementation and training of the predictive model will be provided upon publication.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook file [EDA.ipynb](EDA.ypynb) to access the exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook.

Note: Currently, only the notebook for the exploratory data analysis is available in this repository. The complete dataset and other project files will be provided upon publication. Stay tuned for updates on how to access the full dataset.
