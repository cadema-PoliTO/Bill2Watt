# Bill2Watt

*Bill2Watt* is a repository on GitHub that contains a Python package called **bill2watt**. The package focuses on data-driven prediction of hourly load profiles from time-of-use energy bills.

## Description

The *bill2watt* package provides functionality for training data-driven models to predict hourly load profiles of heterogeneous and numerous electricity end users. 
It leverages the time-of-use energy bill, which offers valuable insights into the consumption patterns of the end users. 
The package implements multiple models to effectively map energy bills to their corresponding load profiles, including standard load profiles, classification, and regression.

In addition to the package, the repository includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook (**eda.ipynb**) that demonstrates data analysis techniques and provides insights into the dataset's characteristics and electricity consumption patterns. 
The EDA notebook serves as an example of how to explore the data related to load profiles.
